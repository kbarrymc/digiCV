    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p><div class="about_me">I'm a highly motivated QA Analyst who enjoys to get into the deeper end of testing. I enjoy the tecnical side of testing and do not let a task beat me. Im very capable of working alone but at the same time I know
        when it is time to give in and ask for help rather than wasting value work hours on something that a collegue could help with.
        I've worked in large teams in the past and have been tasked with the job of coaching newcomers to the projects. To do this I created a learning plan and time schedule
        so that the trainee and I both knew what was ahead of us and could allocate some time each day for questions that they may have for me. I particulary enjoy being part of a team and knowing that people feel they can approach me to ask for help at anytime.
   <br>
   <br>
        The majority of my QA career has been spent in an Agile environment which I believe works best, for me working along side the developement team, Product Owners, Scrum Masters and Business Analysts is key.<br>
  It means that I get the full scope of whats being worked on and what is coming in the next sprints. I get to find bugs as soon as each small unit is interegrated rather than waiting for a large peice of functionality to be introduced and potentially upset what has already passed testing.
  The addition of the Agile ceremonys means that we have a Sprint plan where we can priortise work items from the backlog and set a timeline that we need to work against for each sprint, then when the sprint ends all team members have the opportunity to give their retrospective opinion on what could have been done better to increase efficiency.
    <br>
    <br>
While in my position in Challenge Curve it was recognised by my peer group that I was a team player and people often came to me for advise, for this reason I was moninated by my peers to apply for a management role. Once I was notifed that I was successful I then applied to the local college to learn more about the theories of Leadership and Management just to give me that better understand as not every person can be approached with in the same manner and we all have different motivators.</p>
